LISP-ON-LINES

This is a very early release, and there are more bugs then docs. HERE BE DRAGONS!

Having said that, LOL has been used to deliver applications and is undergoing extensive development.

Take a look at the doc/ directory to get started. The (poorly commented) code is your next stop. 
Adding docstrings would be a good idea.

drewc@tech.coop or #tech.coop on freenode for support.. that we have plenty of.
